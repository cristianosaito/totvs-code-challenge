# TOTVS Labs Coding Challenge - Web
Our Angular coding challenge is an web-app to create a simple product catalog. Where a user can login using *their* google account, see a list of existing products, add a new product with a picture, edit a product and remove a product.

```
Important: Please make sure you use TypeScript, Routes, form validation and some state management (simply RxJS, Akita or NgRX). 
Check your solution into github with a readme.md file detailing instructions 
on how to get the app up and running.
```

# Main Features of the app

### 1) Signup and Authentication (optional)
Users should be able to login/signup using their Google account.

### 2) Create a product
Users should be able to create a new product by informing:
- Name

- Picture (here the user should be able to add a picture from a gallery)

### 2) Product List

Users should be able to see a list of all existing products in the catalog. The list should present the name and picture of the product.

### 3) Delete a Product

From the list of products, users should be able to delete an existing product.
