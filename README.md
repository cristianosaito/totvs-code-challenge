# TOTVS Labs Coding Challenge - Web
Our Angular coding challenge is an web-app to create a simple product catalog. Where a user can login using *their* google account, see a list of existing products, add a new product with a picture, edit a product and remove the product.

```
Important: Please make sure you use TypeScript, Routes, form validation and RxJs for state management. 
Check your solution into github with a readme.md file detailing instructions 
on how to get the app up and running..
